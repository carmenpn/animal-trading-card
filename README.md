# What is this project?

This is one of the first projects I have ever made. It's supposed to be a trading card about my favorite animal.

## How do I open it?

You don't have to install the application.
Just open the html file into your favorite browser.

## What should I see?

You will be seeing my favorite cat:
- a short summary about it
- a few interesting facts
- and a photo of it
